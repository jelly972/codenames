# Codename - Word Game Project

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- Redis for game state persistence
- Vitest for testing

## Project Structure
- `src/app/` - Next.js pages and API routes
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/lib/` - Core game logic and utilities
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## General Guidelines
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Keep game logic pure and testable in `src/lib/`
- Use existing abstractions before creating new ones
- Follow established naming conventions in the codebase
