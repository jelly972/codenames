# React Component Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Props should be typed inline for simple components
- Extract complex prop types to interfaces with `Props` suffix

## Naming
- PascalCase for component files and names
- Components should have descriptive, specific names

## Patterns
- Use the `useGame` hook for game state access
- Keep components focused - split large components
- Colocate component-specific styles when possible
